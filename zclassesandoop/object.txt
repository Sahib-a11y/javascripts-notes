Here's ehat happen behind the scenes when the new keyword is used:

A new object is created: the new keyword initiates the creation of a new javascript object.

A prototype is linked : the newly created object gets linked to the prototype property of the constructor function. this means that it has access to properties and methods defined.

The constructor is called : the constructor function us called with specified arguments and this is bound to the newly created object. if no explicits return value is specified from the constructor. javascript assums this.

The new object is returned : After the constructor function has been called , id it doesn't return a non-primitive value (object , array, function, etc.) , the newly created object is returned.
